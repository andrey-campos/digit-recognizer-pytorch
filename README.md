# digit-recognizer-pytorch
A simple three-layer neural network that uses the Adam optimization algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Implemented using Pytorch. 

The purpose of this project is to build a simple neural network using all the crucial elements in Pytorch, from its neural network module to its optimization algorithms, it is meant to showcase how efficient and readable machine learning code can be with the framework.

To able to use this project first make sure you have all packages downloaded to the version being used inside the code
this includes: Pytorch, pandas, and numpy.

To run this project and see its performance, make sure that your MNIST is downloaded and set up on your local computer and able to be processed for the pandas framework.
